## GAN model for making chess-like and checkers-like board game

### Abstract:

This repository contains an attempt to connect two pretrained GAN models together. One model is going to be trained to make boards, the other is going to be trained to make pieces and by connecting these two, we want to get new, never-seen-before chess-like boardgames.
The steps of the project:
- Train the model for boards
- Train another model for pieces
- Connect the two Generators with two dense layers
- Make a new Discriminator
- Use transfer learning to train the new model

In the project, there will be in the future Google Colab Python Notebooks, and an organized filesystem
